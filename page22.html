GTA also offers an online multiplayer game where you can create your own gang with fellow players and build your own company. In my opinion, the GTA franchise is the best one to ever do it, it has a part on my childhood as I played their games from GTA San Andreas and others. Until now I’m still also waiting for the upcoming release of GTA VI since the last game is released for almost 7 years now.</p></div>

In an update on 2018, Valve added a Battle Royale type game mode in CSGO called Dangerzone. One more reason that the game still attracts a lot of players is because of its continuous updates and new added features to the game. CSGO is available on Steam for free though it was a game you need to pay for before they made it free to play on late 2018.&nbsp;</div>
